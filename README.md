Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    
    This application was designed to be a weight-tracking application with at least 3 screens: Login, view daily weight, and enter daily weight. This application was for users who would like to set and work towards a personal weight goal of their choosing. While the design of my app was completed, I ran out of time to actually finish the development of the application. However, the design and App Release Plan are solid.
    
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  
    To support the user needs for this application, I designed 3 main screens for the user to interface with. These screens were the login screen, the daily weight display screen, and the weight entering screen. The login screen allowed the user to either login to an existing account within the app or create a new one. The Daily Weight screen displayed a grid of each weight entry for each day the user had entered it. The Weight Entry screen had a simple input box and save button that allowed the user to either edit or enter in a new weight entry. The simplistic design and minimal interactive components make my application easy to understand and use.
    
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

    When it came to coding my app, I largely relied on information and skills gained from the course's ZyBooks material. The material taught me how to properly use Andorid Studio to do things like create accessible buttons, create a database, and switch from screen to screen within the app. I could certainly apply these skills in the future to any other Android Studio apps I might develop.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

    For the code I did write, I tested it by using the Android Studio debugger to make sure that each function I wrote was behaving properly. It's extremely important to test each facet of your application to make sure it is safe for users to use and secure. For example, in my initial testing I found that a comparison I made in my functions would always return true!

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

    I had to get pretty creative when it came to using the Android Studio layout editor to create each of my application's layouts. Actually using the editor is much different that simply learning about the components and how they relate to each other.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

    I believe that I was particularly succesfull in drafting a proper plan of release for my application. I think that my prior work experience skills in this area served to provide me with appropriate and successful goals when planning the potential monetization and release of my app.
